## First Time Setup
#### Tailwind CSS
- run `yarn` or `npm install`
- process the CSS with `make css/main.css`
    - the CSS needs to be processed after every change made in the [css/tailwind.css](./css/tailwind.css) and / or [tailwind.config.js](./tailwind.config.js) files

## Building
- set up production directory (docs) and build the site by running `make` from inside the root dir
    - make sure to install the tools (can be found in the [Makefile](./Makefile)) used to minify / optimize website assets
